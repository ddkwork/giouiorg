This month was quiet on the `main` branches, but an exciting and long-requested feature is coming: color glyph rendering. This will allow Gio to display text using many color emoji fonts, as well as some bitmap fonts. I have a working prototype, but editing text with emoji revealed that our text editor desperately needs to support UAX#29 grapheme clusters in order for cursor positioning within emoji to make sense. I'm tackling that problem right now. I'd like to thank Plato Team for supporting this project.

## Changes by repo

Below you can find summaries and details of all changes across the official project repositories.

### core gio

Dominik greatly improved list scrolling efficiency in core this month. Thanks Dominik!

Dominik Honnef:

- **`widget/material`**: use more efficient way of scrolling lists.  [5f818bc5](https://git.sr.ht/~eliasnaur/gio/commit/5f818bc5)
- **`layout`**: add API for efficiently scrolling to and by items. The majority of scrolling happens by manipulating the index of the first displayed item instead of by just manipulating the offset. This lets us avoid having to render all items that were scrolled past. [8af44726](https://git.sr.ht/~eliasnaur/gio/commit/8af44726)

Elias Naur:

- **`go.*`**: bump golang.org/x/text.  [bb12508a](https://git.sr.ht/~eliasnaur/gio/commit/bb12508a)

### gio-x

Dominik made the Resize component smarter, and Sebastien improved the internals of the Linux implementation of explorer. Thanks to you both!

Sebastien Binet:

- **`explorer`**: refactor importFile{,s} for Linux. This CL refactors `importFile{,s}` for Linux. it also prepares for the ability to modify the "label" of the file(s) opening dialog. (so this can be adapted for localization/internationalization.) [a8f5094](https://git.sr.ht/~whereswaldon/gio-x/commit/a8f5094)

Dominik Honnef:

- **`resize`**: maintain ratio when changing constraints. Before this change, changing the constraints (e.g. by resizing a window) would have the following behavior: [6822f59](https://git.sr.ht/~whereswaldon/gio-x/commit/6822f59)

Chris Waldon:

- **`outlay(grid)`**: update scrolling logic. This helps with scrolling jankiness, thanks to Ortwin Wittmann for the suggested fix. [ea2f4a8](https://git.sr.ht/~whereswaldon/gio-x/commit/ea2f4a8)
