The [`paint`](https://gioui.org/op/paint) package provides operations for drawing graphics.

Coordinates are based on the top-left corner, although it's possible to [transform the coordinate system](https://gioui.org/op#TransformOp). This means `f32.Point{X:0, Y:0}` is the top left corner of the window. All drawing operations use pixel units, see [Units](#units) section for more information.

For example, the following code will draw a 100x100 pixel colored rectangle at the top left corner of the window:

<{{files/architecture/draw.go}}[/START DRAWING OMIT/,/END DRAWING OMIT/]

<pre style="min-height: 100px" data-run="wasm" data-pkg="architecture" data-args="draw-paint" data-size="200x100"></pre>

The `defer`ed line is only deferring the `.Pop()` operation at the end, so we push a rectangular clipping area, set the color to red with `paint.ColorOp`, and then instruct Gio to paint the current area with the current color with `paint.PaintOp`.

## Offset

Operation [`op.TransformOp`](https://gioui.org/op#TransformOp) translates the position of the operations that come after it.

For example, the following function offsets the red rectangle 100 pixels to the right:

<{{files/architecture/draw.go}}[/START TRANSFORMATION OMIT/,/END TRANSFORMATION OMIT/]

<pre style="min-height: 100px" data-run="wasm" data-pkg="architecture" data-args="draw-transformation" data-size="200x100"></pre>

Again, note that we are `defer`ing the `.Pop()` of the offset. This means that the offset is applied for the duration of the function, then removed.

## Clipping

In some cases we want the drawing to be confined to a non-rectangular shape, for example to avoid overlapping drawings. Package [`gioui.org/op/clip`](https://gioui.org/op/clip) provides exactly that.

[`clip.RRect`](https://gioui.org/op/clip#RRect) clips all subsequent drawing operations to a rectangle with rounded corners. This is useful as a basis for a button background:

<{{files/architecture/draw.go}}[/START CLIPPING OMIT/,/END CLIPPING OMIT/]

<pre style="min-height: 100px" data-run="wasm" data-pkg="architecture" data-args="draw-clip" data-size="200x100"></pre>

For more complex clipping [`clip.Path`](https://gioui.org/op/clip#Path) can express shapes built from lines and b√©zier curves. This example draws a triangle with a curved edge:

<{{files/architecture/draw.go}}[/START CLIP TRIANGLE OMIT/,/END CLIP TRIANGLE OMIT/]

<pre style="min-height: 100px" data-run="wasm" data-pkg="architecture" data-args="draw-clip-triangle" data-size="200x100"></pre>

## Lines

To draw lines we can use [`clip.Stroke`](https://gioui.org/op/clip#Stroke)
instead of [`clip.Outline`](https://gioui.org/op/clip#Outline). Stroke draws a fixed-width line along a path, whereas Outline simply does not allow drawing outside of the described path area.
We can also use the [`paint.FillShape`](https://gioui.org/op/paint#FillShape) helper
to avoid managing the clip state or use `ColorOp` or `PaintOp`. `paint.FillShape` lets us specify
an `*op.Ops`, a `color.NRGBA`, and a `clip.AreaOp`, and it takes care of filling the clipped
area with the color.

It's possible to use the predefined shapes, such as [`clip.RRect`](https://gioui.org/op/clip#RRect):

<{{files/architecture/draw.go}}[/START STROKE RECT OMIT/,/END STROKE RECT OMIT/]

<pre style="min-height: 100px" data-run="wasm" data-pkg="architecture" data-args="draw-stroke-rect" data-size="200x100"></pre>

Or use a custom shape drawn with [`clip.Path`](https://gioui.org/op/clip#Path):

<{{files/architecture/draw.go}}[/START STROKE TRIANGLE OMIT/,/END STROKE TRIANGLE OMIT/]

<pre style="min-height: 100px" data-run="wasm" data-pkg="architecture" data-args="draw-stroke-triangle" data-size="200x100"></pre>



For dashes, stroke end caps and joins, there's a separate package [gioui.org/x/stroke](https://gioui.org/x/stroke).
However, they are not as performant as `clip.Stroke`, as the work to construct the path
description must be performed on the CPU.


## Operation Stack

Some operations affect all operations that follow them. For example, [`paint.ColorOp`](https://gioui.org/op/paint#ColorOp) sets the "brush" color that is used in subsequent [`paint.PaintOp`](https://gioui.org/op/paint#PaintOp) operations. This drawing context also includes coordinate transformation (set by [`op.TransformOp`](https://gioui.org/op#TransformOp)) and clipping (set by [`clip.Op`](https://gioui.org/op/clip#Op)).

Some operations, such as clips and transformations, allow you to temporarily apply them and later restore the previous state.

For example, the `redButtonBackground` function in the previous section has the unfortunate side-effect of clipping all later operations to the outline of the button background! Let's make a version of it that doesn't affect any callers:

<{{files/architecture/draw.go}}[/START STACK OMIT/,/END STACK OMIT/]

<pre style="min-height: 100px" data-run="wasm" data-pkg="architecture" data-args="draw-stack" data-size="200x100"></pre>

## Drawing Order {#macros}

Drawing happens from back to front. Things inserted into the `op.Ops` first are drawn first, and
later elements will be drawn on top. In this function the green rectangle is drawn on top of red rectangle:

<{{files/architecture/draw.go}}[/START DRAWORDER OMIT/,/END DRAWORDER OMIT/]

<pre style="min-height: 100px" data-run="wasm" data-pkg="architecture" data-args="draw-draworder" data-size="200x100"></pre>

Sometimes you may want to change this order. For example, you may want to delay drawing to apply a transform that is calculated during drawing, or you may want to perform a list of operations several times. For this purpose there is [op.MacroOp](https://gioui.org/op#MacroOp).

<!-- TODO: Use a more practical example here. -->

<{{files/architecture/draw.go}}[/START MACRO OMIT/,/END MACRO OMIT/]

<pre style="min-height: 100px" data-run="wasm" data-pkg="architecture" data-args="draw-macro" data-size="550x200"></pre>

## Animation

Gio only issues FrameEvents when the window is resized or the user interacts with the window. However, animation requires continuous redrawing until the animation is completed. For that there is [`op.InvalidateOp`](https://gioui.org/op#InvalidateOp).

The following code will animate a red "progress bar" that fills up from left to right over 10 seconds from when the program starts:

<{{files/architecture/draw.go}}[/START ANIMATION OMIT/,/END ANIMATION OMIT/]

<pre style="min-height: 100px" data-run="wasm" data-pkg="architecture" data-args="draw-animation" data-size="200x100"></pre>

## Record and replay

While `op.MacroOp` allows you to record and replay operations on a single operation list, [`op.CallOp`](https://gioui.org/op#CallOp) allows for reuse of a separate operation list. This is useful for caching operations that are expensive to re-create, or for animating the disappearance of otherwise removed widgets:

<{{files/architecture/draw.go}}[/START CACHE OMIT/,/END CACHE OMIT/]

<pre style="min-height: 100px" data-run="wasm" data-pkg="architecture" data-args="draw-cache" data-size="200x100"></pre>

Note: For this cache to actually save any work across frames, you'll need to allocate the cache's `op.Ops` somewhere that persists across frames. Doing it in a local variable like this will mean that the cache is recreated every frame.

## Images

[`paint.ImageOp`](https://gioui.org/op/paint#ImageOp) is used to draw images. Like [`paint.ColorOp`](https://gioui.org/op/paint#ColorOp), it sets part of the drawing context (the "brush") that's used for subsequent [`PaintOp`](https://gioui.org/op/paint#PaintOp). [`ImageOp`](https://gioui.org/op/paint#ImageOp) is used similarly to [`ColorOp`](https://gioui.org/op/paint#ColorOp).

Note that [`image.NRGBA`](https://golang.org/pkg/image#NRGBA) and [`image.Uniform`](https://golang.org/pkg/image#Uniform) images are efficient and treated specially. Other [`Image`](https://golang.org/pkg/image#Image) implementations will undergo a more expensive copy and conversion to the underlying image model.

<{{files/architecture/draw.go}}[/START IMAGE OMIT/,/END IMAGE OMIT/]

<pre style="min-height: 100px" data-run="wasm" data-pkg="architecture" data-args="draw-image" data-size="200x100"></pre>

The image must not be mutated until another [`FrameEvent`](https://gioui.org/io/system#FrameEvent) happens, because the image may be read asynchronously while the frame is being drawn. Additionally, mutations to the image provided to `paint.ImageOp` are not guaranteed to ever be reflected in the drawn content. To update an image on-screen, create a new image.Image and construct a new `paint.ImageOp`.
