Transito is a FOSS data-provider-agnostic public transportation app that lets you route between locations using openly available public GTFS feeds. The app's GTFS feed search functionality includes over 1,500 public GTFS feeds with many common metros. Once data is fetched, routing calculations are performed entirely offline / right on your phone.
